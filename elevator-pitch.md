# CYRUS NETWORK
## The Trust Layer for Global Commerce

### The Problem: $2 Trillion in Trapped Value

Maria, a Filipino nurse in Dubai, sends $500 home monthly. Western Union takes $40 (8%) and 3-5 days. Meanwhile, Starbucks waits 90 days to pay Ethiopian coffee farmers through 6 intermediaries. A German company buying renewable energy certificates from India loses 20% to brokers.

**The pattern:** Moving value across borders is expensive, slow, and broken—not because technology doesn't exist, but because **trust infrastructure doesn't scale.**

---

### The Solution: Abstracted Value Transfer Protocol

Cyrus is the first protocol that **works for ANY type of value exchange** — because it doesn't define what "value" means.

**Same infrastructure handles:**
- Remittances (send USDC → deliver cash)
- Supply chains (escrow → verify coffee quality → pay farmer)
- Energy markets (trade renewable certificates)
- Marketplaces (international eBay/Etsy trades)
- Services (milestone-based freelance payments)

**One protocol. Infinite use cases.**

**How it works:**
1. Alice locks $100 USDC in a smart contract
2. Bob (a verified broker) confirms delivery to Carol
3. Carol confirms receipt
4. Payment releases automatically
5. Reputation scores update on-chain

What Bob delivered is **abstracted away** — the protocol only coordinates: *escrow → verification → settlement.*

---

### Why This Works

**Non-custodial:** Cyrus Network never touches user funds. Smart contracts manage escrow; we provide coordination.
**Regulatory arbitrage:** We're infrastructure, not a money transmitter.
**Human + crypto:** Smart contracts for settlement, local brokers for verification.
**Network effects:** Each broker serves multiple use cases; each use case adds liquidity.

---

### Market Opportunity

**Phase 1 - Remittances:** $700B market, 7-10% fees
**Phase 2 - Marketplaces:** eBay, Etsy—$400B cross-border friction
**Phase 3 - Supply Chains:** Fortune 500 direct-to-supplier payments
**Phase 4 - Energy/Carbon:** Renewable certificates, carbon credits

**One protocol. Infinite possibilities.**

### The Killer Use Cases

**For Individuals:** Filipino nurses save $6B annually on remittances
**For Marketplaces:** eBay unlocks $400B in international trades
**For Enterprises:** Starbucks pays farmers instantly with quality verification
**For Energy:** Indian solar farms sell RECs directly to BMW with instant settlement
**For NGOs:** UN distributes aid in war zones without corrupt intermediaries

---

### Business Model

- **0.5-1% protocol fee** on all transactions
- **Premium broker tools** (analytics, liquidity management)
- **Enterprise SDK licensing** for Fortune 500 integrations
- **Future token** for staking, governance, fee discounts

---

### Why Now

✓ Stablecoins are mainstream
✓ Smart contracts are battle-tested
✓ Post-COVID digital payments adoption
✓ Regulatory clarity improving (non-custodial design may offer advantages)
✓ $2T+ addressable with existing tech

### Competitive Moats

1. **Broker Network** — Network effects; 1,000+ trusted verifiers globally
2. **Reputation Data** — Multi-year transaction history creates switching costs
3. **Protocol Abstraction** — Works for any value exchange; competitors locked into verticals

### Vision

We're not building a better Western Union.
We're building the **trust layer for the internet economy.**
