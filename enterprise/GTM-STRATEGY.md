# Go-to-Market Strategy: Supply Chain First

> **Strategic Decision: Launch with enterprise supply chain, not consumer remittances**

---

## Executive Summary

While Cyrus Network's Abstracted Value Transfer Protocol (AVTP) can serve multiple use cases (remittances, marketplaces, supply chain, energy), we are prioritizing **enterprise supply chain** as our initial go-to-market strategy.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates regulatory risk (B2B services, not money transmission)
- Solves broker network problem (enterprises provide their own brokers)
- Better unit economics (larger transactions, enterprise contracts)
- Clearer sales process (B2B with measurable ROI)
- Creates broker infrastructure that enables remittances later

**This is NOT a pivot.** Supply chain has always been part of the vision (Phase 3 in original roadmap). We're simply **reordering the phases** based on risk/reward analysis.

---

## Why Supply Chain First?

### 1. Regulatory Advantage

**Remittances (original Phase 1):**
- Classified as money transmission in most jurisdictions
- Requires MSB licenses, AML/KYC compliance
- 12-24 months to get regulatory clarity
- High legal costs ($200K-500K)

**Supply Chain (new Phase 1):**
- B2B quality verification services
- Escrow is incidental to core service
- Standard commercial contracts
- Minimal regulatory friction
- **Can launch in 3-6 months vs. 12-24 months**

### 2. Broker Network Solved

**Remittances:**
- We recruit brokers (hard)
- We train brokers (expensive)
- We ensure liquidity (risky)
- Need network effects before it's useful

**Supply Chain:**
- **Customers deploy their own brokers**
- Starbucks hires quality auditors in Ethiopia
- BMW hires energy verifiers in India
- No network effects needed for first customer
- **Each customer is self-contained**

### 3. Better Unit Economics

| Metric | Remittances | Supply Chain |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Avg transaction | $500 | $50,000 |
| Protocol fee (1%) | $5 | $500 |
| CAC | $50 (B2C) | $10,000 (B2B) |
| Payback period | 10 transactions | 20 transactions |
| Contract value | N/A | $200K-2M/year |
| Sales cycle | Viral/organic | 6-12 months |
| Customer LTV | $420 | $5M+ |

**Supply chain = 100x better economics per customer**

### 4. Enables Future Remittances

**The strategic insight:**

Once we have enterprise supply chain working:
- Starbucks has brokers in Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia
- BMW has brokers in India, Chile
- These same brokers can do remittances as side income
- **Broker network exists without us building it**

**We flip the model:**
- Don't build broker network THEN find customers
- Find customers who BUILD broker network THEN add remittances

---

### Phase 3: Add Remittances (Year 3)

**Goal:** Leverage existing broker network for P2P remittances

**Now remittances work because:**
- 500+ brokers exist in Ethiopia, Colombia, Philippines (from supply chain)
- Brokers have 2+ years of reputation data
- Infrastructure is proven
- Regulatory approach is established

**What we build:**
- Consumer app (remittance UX)
- Broker marketplace (match senders to brokers)
- P2P routing optimization

**Success metrics:**
- 50,000 remittance users
- $100M remittance volume
- Brokers earning from both supply chain + remittances

---

### Phase 4: Full Ecosystem (Year 4-5)

**Goal:** Protocol for all value transfer

**Expansion:**
- Marketplaces (eBay, Etsy escrow)
- Freelance platforms (Upwork integration)
- Aid distribution (NGO/UN pilots)
- Token launch (governance, staking)

**Success metrics:**
- $10B+ GMV across all use cases
- $100M+ revenue
- 50,000+ brokers globally
- Market leader in AVTP category

---

## Why This Changes Everything

### Old Roadmap (Remittances First):
```
Year 1: Build broker network for remittances (hard, regulatory risk)
  ↓
Year 2: IF that works, add supply chain
  ↓
Year 3: IF that works, expand to other verticals
```

**Problems:**
- Regulatory blocker in Year 1 (might never start)
- Network effects take forever
- Hard to prove ROI to investors
- High failure risk

### New Roadmap (Supply Chain First):
```
Year 1: Enterprise customers deploy brokers (easier, no regulatory risk)
  ↓
Year 2: Expand to more enterprises, become infrastructure
  ↓
Year 3: Leverage broker network for remittances (network already exists!)
  ↓
Year 4: Full ecosystem
```

**Advantages:**
- Start immediately (no regulatory blocker)
- Customers solve broker problem
- Clear ROI from day 1
- Lower execution risk
- Remittances become easier (not harder)

## Competitive Positioning

### We're NOT Competing With:

**Remittance companies (Western Union, Wise):**
- Different customers (enterprises vs. consumers)
- Different use case (procurement vs. money transfer)
- Not direct competition (yet)

### We ARE Competing With:

**Supply chain finance/verification:**
- Traditional importers/exporters (middlemen we're replacing)
- Supply chain SaaS (Sourcemap, Provenance)
- Blockchain traceability (IBM Food Trust, VeChain)

**Our advantage:**
- We handle payments + verification (they only do tracking)
- Lower cost (blockchain native, not enterprise blockchain)
- Faster (smart contracts vs. enterprise integrations)

---

## Investment Narrative

### Old Pitch (Remittances):
"We're disrupting Western Union with blockchain"
- VCs have heard this 100 times
- Regulatory risk scares them
- Long path to revenue

### New Pitch (Supply Chain):
"We're solving Fortune 500 supply chain transparency and payments"
- Enterprise SaaS (VCs love this)
- Clear ROI, B2B sales
- "Starbucks pilot customer" (instant credibility)
- Remittances as future upside (not core dependency)

**This gets funded.**

---

## Sales Strategy (Year 1)

### Target Customer Profile

**Must have:**
- Developing country supply chain (Ethiopia, India, Colombia, Ghana)
- Public ESG/sustainability commitments
- Procurement pain (high costs, low transparency)
- Budget for innovation ($500K+ pilot)

**Ideal companies:**
1. **Starbucks** - Coffee (Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia)
2. **Patagonia** - Textiles (India, Bangladesh, Vietnam)
3. **Mars/Hershey** - Cocoa (Ghana, Ivory Coast)
4. **BMW/Tesla** - Batteries/energy (Chile, India)
5. **Whole Foods** - Organic produce (multiple countries)

### Pitch Approach

**Decision maker:** VP of Procurement, Chief Sustainability Officer

**Email subject:** "Save $50M on coffee procurement while improving farmer income"

**Pitch:**
> "We help Fortune 500 companies pay suppliers directly using smart contract escrow and local verification brokers.
>
> Starbucks pays $24/kg for coffee that farmers receive $3/kg for. We can get that to $9/kg for farmers, $18/kg for Starbucks.
>
> 6-month pilot, our cost. Full traceability, instant farmer payment, 25% savings.
>
> 15-minute call to share the model?"

**ROI calculator:**
- Spreadsheet showing their current costs vs. Cyrus costs
- Conservative estimates (prove we're realistic)
- Year 1 savings vs. implementation cost

**Tech stack:** Same as technical architecture doc
- Polygon for smart contracts
- Next.js for web apps
- React Native for mobile
- IPFS for verification proofs

## Financial Model (Supply Chain Focus)

### Revenue Streams

**1. Protocol Fees:** 0.5% of transaction value
- Starbucks pays $50K for coffee shipment
- We take $250 per transaction
- 1,000 transactions/year = $250K from one customer

**2. Enterprise Licensing:** $200K-2M/year
- Annual contract for platform access
- White-label options (higher tier)
- Support + training included

**3. Broker Tools (Premium):** $50/month per broker
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-corridor management
- Liquidity optimization
- 100 brokers = $5K/month = $60K/year

### Year 1 Projections (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- 5 enterprise customers
- Average contract: $200K/year
- Average GMV per customer: $12M/year
- Protocol fee: 0.5%

**Revenue:**
- Licensing: 5 × $200K = $1M
- Protocol fees: $60M × 0.5% = $300K
- Broker tools: 50 brokers × $50 × 12 = $30K
- **Total Year 1: $1.33M**

**Costs:**
- Engineering: $600K (4 devs + 1 lead)
- Sales: $400K (2 sales + 1 BDR)
- Legal/ops: $200K
- Infrastructure: $50K
- **Total costs: $1.25M**

**Result: Break-even or small profit in Year 1**

(Contrast with remittances: would need $20M GMV to reach $200K revenue at 1% fee)

## Risk Analysis

### Remaining Risks

**1. Enterprise Sales Cycle (Medium risk)**
- 6-12 months to close first deal
- Need credibility without customers
- Mitigation: Free pilot, strong ROI calculator, advisor from target industry

**2. Verification Quality (Medium risk)**
- Broker mistakes = bad coffee delivered
- Customer churns immediately
- Mitigation: Training, insurance, reputation system, enterprise does final QA

**3. Customer Concentration (Low risk)**
- 80% revenue from 2 customers = risky
- Mitigation: Sign 5+ customers ASAP, diversify verticals

**4. Technology Execution (Low risk)**
- Smart contracts need to work perfectly
- Mitigation: Audits, testnet, extensive testing

### Eliminated Risks (vs Remittances)

✅ Regulatory (supply chain ≠ money transmission)
✅ Broker network (customers provide brokers)
✅ Liquidity (enterprise funds escrow)
✅ Network effects (not needed for first customer)

## Conclusion

**Supply chain first is the right GTM strategy because:**

1. **Faster to market** (no regulatory blocker)
2. **Better economics** (enterprise contracts vs. consumer transactions)
3. **Solves broker problem** (customers provide brokers)
4. **Enables future remittances** (broker network exists for free)
5. **Easier fundraising** (enterprise SaaS narrative)

**The protocol doesn't change.** AVTP works for supply chain, remittances, energy, marketplaces - same infrastructure.

**We're just choosing the smartest entry point.**
