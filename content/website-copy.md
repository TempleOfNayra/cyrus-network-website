### FAQ

**What is Cyrus Network?**
Cyrus is a decentralized protocol that enables peer-to-peer value exchange across borders using smart contracts and local broker networks.

**How is this different from Western Union?**
We use smart contracts for escrow and local brokers for delivery. This eliminates 5-9% in fees and reduces delivery time from days to hours.

**Do I need to understand crypto?**
No. You interact with simple apps. Crypto is just the settlement layer—you never see it.

**Is my money safe?**
Yes. Funds are held in audited smart contracts (not by us). Brokers can't access escrowed funds—only confirm delivery.

**What if something goes wrong?**
We have a three-tier dispute resolution system with 72-hour resolution targets. Both parties are protected.

**How do brokers make money?**
Brokers earn 0.8% per transaction plus tips. High-reputation brokers access bigger transactions.

**Which countries do you support?**
Currently 50+ countries across Asia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, and Americas. Expanding monthly.

**Can I use this for my business?**
Yes! We offer enterprise solutions for supply chains, marketplaces, and more. [Contact us]
