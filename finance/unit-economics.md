## Unit Economics Comparison

### Remittances (Original Phase 1)

**Average Transaction:**
- Value: $500
- Protocol fee (1%): $5
- Cost per transaction: $0.50 (gas + infrastructure)
- Gross margin: 90% ($4.50 profit per transaction)

**Customer Acquisition:**
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $50
- Channels: Social media ads, influencer marketing, referrals
- Payback period: 11 transactions (at $4.50 profit each)
- Time to payback: 6-12 months (assuming 2 transactions/month)

**Customer Lifetime Value:**
- Average user sends: 2 transactions/month
- Retention: 50% after year 1
- Lifetime: ~24 months
- Transactions: 24-36 lifetime
- LTV: $108-162 (24-36 × $4.50)
- **LTV/CAC ratio: 2-3x** (acceptable but not amazing)

**Path to $1M Revenue:**
- Need: 200,000 transactions
- At 2 per user/month = 100,000 active users
- CAC: $50 × 100,000 = $5M spent on acquisition
- **Revenue: $1M | Spent: $5M = massively unprofitable**

---

### Supply Chain (New Phase 1)

**Average Transaction:**
- Value: $50,000 (coffee shipment, 1,000kg at $50/kg)
- Protocol fee (0.5%): $250
- Cost per transaction: $5 (gas + infrastructure + support)
- Gross margin: 98% ($245 profit per transaction)

**Enterprise Licensing:**
- Annual contract: $200K-2M per customer
- Includes: Platform access, broker tools, support, training
- Gross margin: 85% (dev + support costs)

**Customer Acquisition:**
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $10,000
- Channels: Direct sales, warm intros, conferences
- Sales cycle: 6-12 months
- Payback period: 1 customer (one $200K contract pays back CAC 20x)
- Time to payback: 6-12 months

**Customer Lifetime Value:**
- Average customer contract: $200K/year
- Average transactions: 1,000/year × $250 = $250K protocol fees
- Total revenue per customer: $450K/year
- Retention: 90%+ (high switching cost)
- Lifetime: 5+ years
- **LTV: $2.25M+** (5 years × $450K)
- **LTV/CAC ratio: 225x** (exceptional)

**Path to $1M Revenue:**
- Need: 3 customers at $333K average revenue
- CAC: 3 × $10,000 = $30K total
- **Revenue: $1M | Spent: $30K = 33x ROI**

- Grow to 5,000 users by month 12
- 2 transactions/user/month average
- 1% protocol fee

**Revenue:**
- Month 6: 100 users × 2 tx × $5 = $1,000

## 5-Year Projections

### Remittances Path

| Year | Users | Transactions | Revenue | Costs | Profit/Loss |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 5,000 | 120,000 | $150K | $1.3M | -$1.15M |
| 2 | 50,000 | 1,200,000 | $1.5M | $3M | -$1.5M |

| 5 | 3,000,000 | 72,000,000 | $90M | $30M | +$60M |

**Cumulative:** -$76M (Years 1-2), then profitable

**Requires:** $50M+ raised (high burn before profitability)

---

### Supply Chain Path

| Year | Customers | GMV | Revenue | Costs | Profit/Loss |
|------|-----------|-----|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 5 | $60M | $1.3M | $1.25M | +$50K |

| 3 | 50 | $3B | $65M | $20M | +$45M |
| 4 | 100 | $10B | $200M | $60M | +$140M |
| 5 | 200 | $30B | $500M | $150M | +$350M |

**Cumulative:** Profitable from Year 1

**Requires:** $5M total raised (capital efficient)

## Broker Economics

### Remittances Model

**Broker profile:** Individual money changer in Lagos

**Income sources:**
- Protocol fee share: 0.8% of transaction (we keep 0.2%)
- Average transaction: $500
- Income per transaction: $4

**Volume needed:**
- To make $1,000/month: 250 transactions
- At 8 hours/day, 20 days/month: 160 hours
- **15 transactions per day** (1-2 per hour)

**Challenges:**
- Need high volume quickly
- Requires local liquidity (cash + USDC)
- Competes with existing money changers
- Income uncertainty (variable transactions)

---

### Supply Chain Model

**Broker profile:** Coffee quality auditor in Ethiopia (employed by Starbucks)

**Income sources:**
- Salary from Starbucks: $2,000/month (local rate)
- Bonus per verification: $20
- Verification reputation score (future income potential)

**Volume needed:**
- Base salary covers livelihood
- Protocol earnings are bonus
- **Not dependent on transaction volume**

**Advantages:**
- Stable income (employed by enterprise)
- Professional role (career path)
- Training provided by enterprise
- High-quality service (employer standards)

**This is why supply chain brokers are more reliable.**

---

## Why Supply Chain Economics Work Better

### 1. **Larger Transaction Sizes**
- $50,000 vs. $500 (100x)
- Same effort to process
- 50x revenue per transaction ($250 vs. $5)

### 2. **Predictable Revenue**
- Annual contracts vs. one-time transactions
- Recurring revenue (SaaS model)
- High retention (90%+ vs. 50%)

### 3. **Lower CAC**
- 5 customers vs. 100,000 users
- $50K total CAC vs. $5M
- Focused sales vs. broad marketing

### 4. **Better Margins**
- 98% gross margin (minimal variable costs)
- Enterprise pricing power
- No need for consumer discounts

### 5. **Easier to Prove ROI**
- CFO can calculate savings immediately
- $50M savings on $2.5M cost = clear win
- Consumer behavior change is harder to predict

---

## Path to Profitability

### Remittances Timeline:
- Month 0-6: Regulatory approval
- Month 6-12: Launch, early users
- Month 12-24: Growth but still burning
- Month 24-36: Approaching break-even
- **Profitable in Year 3**

**Requires:** $30M+ raised to survive to profitability

---

### Supply Chain Timeline:
- Month 0-4: Build MVP
- Month 4-6: First pilot
- Month 6-12: Convert to paid + sign 4 more
- **Profitable in Year 1** (or close)

**Requires:** $2-5M raised, capital efficient

---

## Investment Implications

### Remittances Pitch:
"We need $30M to disrupt Western Union"
- High burn, long path to profitability
- Consumer fintech (competitive space)
- Network effects take time
- High risk, high reward

**Investor response:** "Pass - too capital intensive, seen this before"

---

### Supply Chain Pitch:
"We need $3M to sign 20 Fortune 500 customers"
- Low burn, fast path to profitability
- Enterprise SaaS (proven model)
- Immediate value per customer
- Lower risk, clear ROI

**Investor response:** "Interesting - show me the Starbucks pilot"

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### What if we're wrong about supply chain?

**Scenario: Harder to close enterprises**
- Assumption: 5 customers in Year 1
- Reality: Only 2 customers

**Impact:**
- Revenue: $1.33M → $530K
- Still better than remittances ($150K)
- Break-even pushed to Month 18 (still manageable)

**Mitigation:**
- Lower fixed costs (smaller team)
- Extend pilots (prove value longer)
- Add remittances sooner (Year 2 vs. Year 3)

---

### What if remittances grow faster?

**Scenario: Viral growth**
- Assumption: 5,000 users in Year 1
- Reality: 50,000 users (10x)

**Impact:**
- Revenue: $150K → $1.5M
- But marketing costs: $250K → $2.5M
- Still -$2.3M in Year 1 (worse than supply chain)

**Takeaway:** Even best-case remittances is worse than base-case supply chain in Year 1.

## Stress-Test Scenarios: What Could Go Wrong?

***This section tests unit economics under adverse conditions to understand break-even requirements and failure modes.***

### Scenario 1: High Broker Churn (Remittances)

**Assumptions (base case):**
- Broker churn: 20%/year
- Replacement cost: $1,000 per broker

**Stress test: 50% annual churn**
- Need to replace 250 of 500 brokers
- Cost: $250,000 additional
- Impact on Year 1: -$250K (turns $150K revenue into -$100K)

**Break-even requirement:**
- Need 50,000 additional transactions to cover churn
- Or 25,000 additional active users
- **Conclusion:** High broker churn makes remittances unviable without significant scale

### Scenario 2: High Dispute Rate

**Assumptions (base case):**
- Dispute rate: 2%
- Resolution cost: $50 per dispute (manual review, arbitration)

**Stress test: 5% dispute rate**
- 200,000 transactions × 5% = 10,000 disputes
- Cost: 10,000 × $50 = $500,000
- Impact: Wipes out all profit

**Break-even requirement:**
- Need automated dispute resolution (reduce cost to <$5)
- Or double transaction volume to absorb costs
- **Conclusion:** Dispute resolution MUST be automated and cheap

### Scenario 3: Gas Fee Spike (All Use Cases)

**Assumptions (base case):**
- Gas cost: $0.10 per transaction (Polygon)

**Stress test: 10x gas increase**
- Gas cost: $1.00 per transaction
- Impact on remittances: $4.50 → $3.60 profit (20% hit)
- Impact on supply chain: $250 → $249 profit (0.4% hit)

**Conclusion:** Supply chain is insulated from gas spikes; remittances are vulnerable

### Scenario 4: Regulatory Block (Remittances)

**Stress test: Nigeria or UK blocks crypto remittances**
- Lagos-London corridor: DEAD
- Year 1 revenue: -$150K
- Pivot required: New corridor from scratch

**Mitigation:**
- Launch 3 corridors simultaneously (not just 1)
- Cost: 3× broker network investment
- But regulatory risk reduced 67%

**Supply chain equivalent:**
- If Starbucks pilot fails, pivot to different enterprise
- Broker network NOT wasted (reusable for different verticals)

### Scenario 5: Competitors Undercut Pricing

**Stress test: Wise drops fees to 0.5% (from 2%)**

**Impact on remittances:**
- Cyrus offers 1%, Wise offers 0.5%
- Competitive advantage shrinks
- Need to drop to 0.75% to compete
- Gross margin: $4.50 → $3.40 (24% reduction)
- Still better than Wise but closer

**Impact on supply chain:**
- No direct competitor (yet)
- Even at 0.5% fee, $250 → $125 per transaction
- Still massively better economics than remittances

**Conclusion:** Supply chain has wider margin for error

### Scenario 6: Enterprise Sales Cycle Longer Than Expected

**Assumptions (base case):**
- Close 5 enterprises in Year 1 (6-month sales cycle each)

**Stress test: 12-month sales cycles**
- Close 2-3 enterprises in Year 1 (not 5)
- Revenue: $1.33M → $530K-800K
- Still cash-flow positive or break-even

**Mitigation:**
- Pilot programs (3 months, $50K)
- Prove ROI before asking for $250K/year contract
- **Conclusion:** Even slow enterprise sales beats fast remittance growth

---

## Summary: Break-Even Analysis

| Scenario | Remittances | Supply Chain |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Base case** | -$4.85M (Year 1) | +$80K (Year 1) |
| **High churn (50%)** | -$5.1M | -$50K |
| **High disputes (5%)** | -$5.35M | +$30K |
| **Gas spike (10x)** | -$5.03M | +$79K |
| **Regulatory block** | Restart from zero | Pivot to new enterprise |
| **Price war** | -$5M+ | Still profitable |
| **Slow sales** | Same | +$30-80K |

**Key insight:** Supply chain remains profitable or break-even in almost every adverse scenario. Remittances remain deeply unprofitable even in best cases.

**Worst-case supply chain:** -$50K (high broker churn)
**Best-case remittances:** -$2.3M (viral growth)

---

## Conclusion

**Supply chain economics are decisively better:**

✅ **100x larger transactions** ($50K vs. $500)
✅ **50x better revenue per transaction** ($250 vs. $5)
✅ **225x better LTV/CAC** (225x vs. 3x)
✅ **Profitable Year 1** (vs. Year 3)
✅ **90% lower capital needs** ($5M vs. $50M)
✅ **Predictable revenue** (contracts vs. transactions)

**The GTM strategy should optimize for:**
1. Fastest path to revenue
2. Lowest capital requirement
3. Highest probability of success

**Supply chain wins on all three.**
