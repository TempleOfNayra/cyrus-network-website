# CYRUS NETWORK — One-Pager

**The Trust Layer for Global Commerce**

---

## The Problem

**$2 trillion in value is trapped annually** in inefficient cross-border transactions:

- **Remittances:** 1 billion transactions at 6-10% fees = $44B lost
- **Cross-border commerce:** $400B in trades don't happen (trust issues)
- **Supply chains:** 60-90 day payment delays cripple small suppliers
- **Energy markets:** 20-25% lost to intermediaries

Traditional finance serves the wealthy. **2.5 billion people are excluded.**

---

## The Solution

**Cyrus Network** introduces the **Abstracted Value Transfer Protocol (AVTP)** — the first infrastructure that coordinates value exchange without defining what "value" means.

### How It Works

```
1. Lock     → Value secured in smart contract escrow
2. Verify   → Local broker confirms real-world delivery
3. Release  → Automatic settlement upon confirmation
```

**Key Innovation:** The protocol doesn't care if you're exchanging cash, coffee beans, energy certificates, or services. Same infrastructure, infinite use cases.

---

## Why It Works

### Three-Layer Architecture

1. **Smart Contract Escrow** — Non-custodial, automated, transparent
2. **Broker Verification Network** — Local agents bridge digital ↔ physical
3. **Reputation System** — On-chain trust creates accountability

### Competitive Advantages

- **1% fees** vs 6-10% traditional
- **Same-day settlement** vs 3-90 days
- **Works for unbanked** (400M+ excluded by competitors)
- **Multiple use cases** on one protocol

## Market Opportunity

| Vertical | Addressable Market | Cyrus Fee | Revenue Potential |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Remittances | $700B | 1% | $7B |
| E-commerce Escrow | $400B | 1.5% | $6B |
| Supply Chain | $5T | 0.5% | $25B |
| Energy/Carbon | $50B | 5% | $2.5B |
| **TOTAL** | **$6.15T** | **~0.75% avg** | **$40B+** |

**Entry point:** Remittances ($700B)
**Expansion:** Supply chains ($5T — highest margin)

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Remittances (Launch Focus)
**User:** Maria, Filipino nurse in Dubai
**Old way:** $40 fee (8%), 3-5 days, family travels 2 hours to collect
**Cyrus way:** $5 fee (1%), same-day, delivered to door
**Annual savings:** $420 (87% reduction)

### 2. Supply Chain Finance
**User:** Ethiopian coffee farmer → Starbucks
**Old way:** 5-6 intermediaries, $3/kg to farmer, 90-day wait
**Cyrus way:** Direct payment, $9/kg to farmer, same-day settlement
**Impact:** Farmer earns 3x, Starbucks saves 25%

### 3. Renewable Energy
**User:** Indian solar farm → BMW (I-REC trading)
**Old way:** $350K received (70% of value), 90 days
**Cyrus way:** $475K received (95% of value), same day
**Impact:** 36% more income for clean energy

### 4. Marketplace Escrow
**User:** Moroccan artisan → US buyer on eBay
**Old way:** No trust mechanism, $400B in lost commerce
**Cyrus way:** Escrow with dual verification, unlock global sales
**Impact:** eBay adds $6B revenue from Cyrus fees alone

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Transaction fees:** 0.5-1% on all value exchanged (primary)
2. **Enterprise licensing:** $50K-500K/year (white-label broker networks)
3. **Premium broker tools:** $20-50/month subscription
4. **Future token:** Staking, governance, fee discounts

### Unit Economics

- **$500 remittance** → $5 fee → $1 to protocol (0.2%)
- **Cost:** ~$0.10 (gas + infrastructure)
- **Gross margin:** 80%+

**SaaS-like margins for a network business.**

## Traction & Milestones

**Current Status:**
- ✓ Protocol architecture complete
- ✓ Smart contracts 70% developed
- ✓ 50 brokers on waitlist
- ✓ 3 enterprise conversations (Fortune 500)
- ⏳ Testnet launch Q1 2025

**Roadmap:**
- **Q2 2025:** Lagos-London corridor live, 1,000 transactions
- **Q3 2025:** 5 corridors, enterprise pilot, SDK public
- **Q4 2025:** $100M GMV, Series A metrics

## Competitive Moats

1. **Network effects** — More brokers → better coverage → more users → more brokers (winner-take-most)
2. **Reputation data** — Multi-year transaction history, non-transferable
3. **Protocol abstraction** — One infrastructure for all use cases (competitors locked into verticals)
4. **Regulatory positioning** — Non-custodial = not a money transmitter

**Once we dominate a corridor, competitors can't catch up.**

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Year | GMV | Revenue | Brokers | Corridors |
|------|-----|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2025 | $6M | $60K | 50 | 1 |
| 2026 | $100M | $1M | 500 | 5 |
| 2027 | $1B | $10M | 2,000 | 20 |
| 2028 | $5B | $50M | 10,000 | 50 |
| 2029 | $20B | $200M | 50,000 | 100+ |

**Path to $100M revenue by Year 4**

## Why Now?

Three convergent trends:

1. **Stablecoin maturity** — $150B in circulation, accepted globally
2. **L2 scaling solved** — Polygon/Arbitrum bring costs to $0.01-0.10 per transaction
3. **Post-COVID digital literacy** — Everyone uses mobile payments now

**The infrastructure is ready. The market is desperate. The window is now.**
