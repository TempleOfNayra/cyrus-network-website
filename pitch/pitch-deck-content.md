## Slide 2: The Problem — Maria's Story

### Visual
- Photo of Maria (nurse in scrubs)
- Money flowing diagram with fees highlighted in red

### Text
**Meet Maria**

Filipino nurse in Dubai earning $3,000/month

**Every month she:**
- Sends $500 to family in Manila
- Pays $40 in fees (8%)
- Waits 3-5 days for delivery
- Her mother travels 2 hours to collect cash

**Annual cost:** $480 in fees + countless hours

**Multiply by 1 billion cross-border transactions annually...**

---

## Slide 3: The $2 Trillion Problem

### Visual
- Infographic showing trapped value across sectors
- World map with money flow barriers

### Text
**Global Value Transfer is Broken**

| Sector | Annual Volume | Lost to Inefficiency |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Remittances | $700B | $44B (6% fees) |
| Cross-border E-commerce | $1T | $400B (trust issues) |
| Supply Chain Finance | $15T | $1.5T (middlemen) |
| Energy/Carbon Markets | $110B | $16.5B (brokers) |

**$2+ TRILLION trapped annually**

Not a technology problem — an **infrastructure problem**

---

## Slide 4: Why Existing Solutions Fail

### Visual
- Four quadrants comparing solutions

### Text
**The Landscape**

**Traditional (Western Union)**
- ✗ 6-10% fees
- ✗ 3-5 day delays
- ✗ Physical locations required

**Fintech (Wise, Remitly)**
- ✓ Better fees (2-4%)
- ✗ Still bank-dependent
- ✗ Limited to banked populations

**Crypto P2P (LocalBitcoins)**
- ✓ Low fees
- ✗ No fiat delivery
- ✗ Scam risk, complexity

**Pure DeFi (Uniswap)**
- ✓ Trustless
- ✗ Crypto-only
- ✗ Can't touch real world

**The gap:** No solution bridges digital trust with real-world delivery

---

## Slide 5: The Solution — Abstracted Value Transfer

### Visual
- Simple flow diagram with 5 steps
- Icons for smart contract + human broker

### Text
**Introducing the Abstracted Value Transfer Protocol**

The protocol doesn't care WHAT you're exchanging:

```
1. Alice locks $100 USDC in smart contract
2. Bob (verified broker) confirms delivery
3. Carol confirms receipt
4. Payment releases automatically
5. Reputation scores update
```

**The innovation:** Protocol coordinates exchange without defining "value"

- Cash? ✓
- Coffee beans? ✓
- Energy certificates? ✓
- Services? ✓

**One protocol for infinite use cases**

---

## Slide 6: How It Works — Three Layers

### Visual
- Three-layer architecture diagram

### Text
**The Cyrus Stack**

**Layer 1: Smart Contract Escrow**
- Non-custodial (Cyrus Network never holds funds; smart contracts manage escrow)
- Automated release on verification
- Polygon/Arbitrum (low fees)

**Layer 2: Broker Verification Network**
- Local agents verify real-world delivery
- Earn fees (0.5-1% of transaction)
- Build reputation on-chain

**Layer 3: Reputation System**
- Immutable trust scores
- Economic accountability
- Network quality improves over time

**Smart contracts + Human verification = Real-world trust at scale**

---

## Slide 7: Maria's New Reality

### Visual
- Before/after comparison with Maria smiling

### Text
**With Cyrus:**

**Maria's experience:**
- Sends from phone in 2 minutes
- Broker delivers cash to family's door (same day)
- Family confirms on SMS
- Smart contract releases payment

**Maria's savings:**
- Old way: $40 per transfer (8%)
- Cyrus way: $5 per transfer (1%)
- **Annual savings: $420** (almost one month's remittance!)

**Multiply by 1 billion transactions = $44B returned to families**

---

## Slide 8: Use Case 2 — Supply Chain Revolution

### Visual
- Split screen: Tadesse (Ethiopian farmer) | Starbucks

### Text
**The Corporate Broker Model**

**Today:**
- Tadesse grows premium coffee ($3/kg)
- 5-6 middlemen take 70% of value
- Waits 90 days for payment
- Starbucks pays $24/kg

**With Cyrus:**
- Starbucks deploys brokers in Ethiopia
- Broker verifies quality at farm
- Smart contract pays Tadesse instantly ($9/kg)
- Starbucks receives beans ($18/kg)

**Result:**
- Tadesse earns 3x more (can send kids to university)
- Starbucks saves 25% and gets traceability
- **Win-win through infrastructure**

---

## Slide 9: Use Case 3 — Renewable Energy

### Visual
- Solar panels + BMW logo

### Text
**Direct I-REC Trading**

**Abhi (India solar farm owner):**

**Old process:**
- Sells renewable energy certificates to BMW
- 3-4 intermediaries take 25% margin
- Waits 90 days for payment
- Receives $350K (70% of value)

**With Cyrus:**
- BMW locks USDC in escrow
- Certified broker verifies energy generation
- Payment releases instantly
- Abhi receives $475K (95% of value)

**$125K more income (36% increase) for the same energy**

European companies get ESG compliance directly from source.

## Slide 10: Market Opportunity — $48B Revenue Potential

### Visual
- Stacked bar chart showing markets

### Text
**Total Addressable Market**

| Vertical | Addressable Market | Fee % | Revenue Potential |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Remittances | $700B | 1% | $7B |
| E-commerce Escrow | $400B | 1.5% | $6B |
| Supply Chain | $5T | 0.5% | $25B |
| Energy/Carbon | $50B | 5% | $2.5B |
| Other Markets | $300B | 2% | $6B |

**Total: $6.45T addressable → $48B revenue potential**

Starting with remittances ($7B TAM), expanding to supply chains ($25B TAM)

## Slide 11: Business Model — High-Margin SaaS

### Visual
- Revenue streams pie chart

### Text
**Multiple Revenue Streams**

**1. Protocol Fees (Primary)**
- 0.5-1% on all transactions
- Charged in USDC (instant settlement)
- ~80% gross margin

**2. Enterprise Licensing**
- $50K-500K/year for corporate broker networks
- White-label dashboards
- Custom integrations

**3. Premium Broker Tools**
- $20-50/month for analytics, liquidity management
- 5,000 brokers × $30/mo = $1.8M annual recurring

**4. Future Token** (optional)
- Staking for brokers
- Governance rights
- Fee discounts

**Unit Economics Example:**
- $500 remittance → $5 fee → $1 to protocol (0.2%)
- Cost per transaction: ~$0.10 (gas + infrastructure)
- **Gross margin: 80%+**

---

## Slide 12: Go-to-Market Strategy

### Visual
- Timeline with milestones

### Text
**Phase 1: Prove Model (Months 1-6)**
- Single corridor: Nigeria (Lagos) → UK (London)
- 50 brokers, 1,000 transactions, $500K volume
- **Milestone:** Unit economics validated

**Phase 2: Expand Corridors (Months 7-12)**

## Slide 13: Traction & Validation

### Visual

## Slide 14: Competitive Moats

### Visual
- Castle moat illustration with four walls

### Text
**Why We Win**

**1. Network Effects (Strongest)**
- More brokers → better coverage → more users → more brokers
- Winner-take-most dynamics in each corridor

**2. Reputation Data**
- Multi-year transaction history
- Brokers can't transfer reputation to competitors
- Switching costs increase over time

**3. Protocol Abstraction**
- Competitors locked into verticals (remittance OR supply chain)
- We do everything on same infrastructure

**4. Regulatory Positioning**
- Non-custodial design (regulatory classification varies by jurisdiction)
- First-mover advantage in regulatory clarity

**Once we dominate Lagos-London, competitors can't catch up**

## Slide 15: Revenue Projections

### Visual
- Hockey stick graph

### Text
**Path to $100M Revenue (5 Years)**

| Year | GMV | Revenue | Margin | EBITDA | Brokers | Corridors |
|------|-----|---------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 2025 | $6M | $60K | 60% | -$2M | 50 | 1 |
| 2026 | $100M | $1M | 70% | -$4M | 500 | 5 |
| 2027 | $1B | $10M | 75% | $2M | 2,000 | 20 |
| 2028 | $5B | $50M | 80% | $25M | 10,000 | 50 |
| 2029 | $20B | $200M | 80% | $120M | 50,000 | 100+ |

**Key assumptions:**
- Average 1% fee across all verticals
- 40% month-over-month growth years 1-3
- Positive unit economics by month 6
- EBITDA positive by year 3

**Comparable exits:**
- Wise (formerly TransferWise): $11B valuation at 0.5% fees
- Stripe: $65B valuation on payments infrastructure
- Cyrus at $20B GMV + supply chain = $5-10B valuation potential
